        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Remix. I am a graphic designer who specializes in illustration and layout.<br><br>Ever since I can remember, I&rsquo;ve been drawing and telling stories. When I was around nine or ten, I started to get into comics, manga, and anime. These mediums changed my life, instilling in me a passion for telling stories through artwork. I quickly started writing and drawing my own comics, and it wasn&rsquo;t long before I had decided I wanted to draw comics for a career.<br><br>I graduated high school in 2020 and took a year and half off before I started considering my options for college. Thinking about my passion for writing stories, I considered English as a major, but I eventually decided against it, instead turning back to my love for comics. Many successful comic artists, I had read, had degrees in Graphic Design, which was a field of study I had been coming back to over and over. It suddenly seemed like a no brainer. I would get my degree in Graphic Design, and then use it to break into comics.<br><br>Fate had other plans, though. I hadn&rsquo;t been in college for long before I realized that Graphic Design was just another way of communicating a message through art. I was hooked. I absorbed as much information as I could about layout, logo design, and photo manipulation. Then, in my third semester, I took a class that challenged me to design my own business. I immediately knew what type of business it would be, and thus, Wise Choice Design was born.<br><br>Today, Wise Choice Design is a freelance design endeavor, seeking to provide you with the freshest, most cutting-edge designs available. I&rsquo;m still a student, but with more than half my degree under my belt, I am more than capable of assisting clients with any of their graphic design related needs. I&rsquo;m so excited to help more people see their visions come to life.
